### About Me

Hello! I bring over a decade of IT experience across multiple roles, everything from frontline customer support to IT Project Management, application portfolio support, as well as IT support business ownership. I'm looking forward to bringing this well-rounded experience into my career as a software developer focused on full-stack JavaScript.
